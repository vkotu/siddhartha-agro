    'description': `<p/>Guava pulp is extracted from the selected varieties of the white and pink guavas, one of the highest sources of Vitamin C. Guava pulp is mainly used to make guava juices, guava jams, fruit bars and fruit cheese. Guava pulp has got good potential as commercial source pectin and is used mainly for conversion into juices, jams, fruit cheese, fruit bars etc.</p>
      <p/>We buy the best quality of guavas and these fruits are first inspected before sending into ripening chambers. Fully ripened guavas are washed and cleaned. We transfer these clean guavas for further processes before extraction of the pulp. These processes are centrifuging, destoning, blanching and homogenization. Then the guavas are sent to extraction chambers in order to obtain the pulp. The complete extraction process includes cleaning, slicing, refining and packing the fruit pulp. The ripe fruit is processed in the most technologically advanced and fully automated manufacturing set-up in Chittoor in excellent conditions by suitable means. We stick to our quality standards and our food technologists monitor the safety and hygiene at every stage.</p> 
      <p/>We try to maintain the natural flavour, taste, aroma and colour of the guava pulp. The flavour of the pulp is typical ripe guava flavour. The colour of the guava pulp is milky white and the taste of the pulp is natural & characteristic ripe guava taste. The pulp is supplied to the international and domestic markets in the state of homogeneous liquid. Though grits are obtained from the fruit, however, the content of grits in the pulp is kept minimal in the pulp. We remove all the impurities from the guava pulp before supplying it. Pesticide residue is not even used in the process. We remove the maximum of grits from the fruit in the pulp.</p>
      <p/>We have a state-of-the-art packaging environment and infrastructure. This enables us to pack the pulp and preserve it at the same time to facilitate the supply for both bulk and urgent orders.</p>`,
